There is a great demand for making more research data openly available. The reproducibility of findings in psychology has been questioned, and more openly available data would make research more transparent and accessible. Unfortunately, many datasets cannot be publicly available for privacy reasons. On the other hand, researchers are increasingly more expected to share data with others for review, reanalysis, and reuse. To solve this issue, we suggest using methods of Statistical Disclosure Control for data anonymisation. These methods either modify or synthesise data so that it can be disclosed without revealing confidential information that may be associated with specific respondents. In this presentation, we review the work in this area and present different anonymisation approaches that can be used to protect data confidentiality. To prove the success of data anonymisation, data utility is discussed as the main objective to be maximised while providing data with a disclosure risk below certain limits. The concepts are illustrated by means of a practical application example.
