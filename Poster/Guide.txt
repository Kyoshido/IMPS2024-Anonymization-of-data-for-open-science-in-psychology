IMPORTANT: The poster boards are vertical (portrait-style) this year. There will be two posters assigned per board (one on each side). Each presenter will have their own poster number assignment per the attached poster flyer.

This is approximately 27.56 inches or 2.30 feet (width/base) x 39.37 inches or 3.28 feet (height). Posters may be printed smaller than the recommended size, but must NOT exceed the A0 paper size, i.e. 84.1 cm (width/base) x 118.9 cm (height). (33.1 inches width/base x 44.6 inches height.)
