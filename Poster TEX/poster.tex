\section{Background}

There is a growing demand for more research data to be made openly available.
The reproducibility of findings is in crisis \cite{2015_OSC}, and more openly available data would make research more transparent and accessible.

However, \textbf{psychological datasets often include sensitive %demographic and health
personal information that necessitates privacy protection}.
% Many psychological datasets contain \textbf{demographic and health variables} that \textbf{require proper protection against disclosure}.
% Unfortunately, many datasets cannot be publicly available for privacy reasons.

            \item[\textbullet] The data for this example is from the Answers to the Machivallianism Test, a version of the MACH-IV from Christie and Geis \cite{Data}, which comprises 73,489 records.

%The dataset utilized for this anonymization example is sourced from the Alzheimer's Disease Dataset \cite{2024_Alzheimer}. It includes variables such as patient info, demographics, lifestyle, medical history, clinical measurements, symptoms, and diagnosis.
    \item[\ding{228}] \textbf{Anonymization tools}
        \begin{itemize}   
            \item[\textbullet] Synthetization was performed using the R package \textbf{synthpop}~\cite{2022_Synthpop}

 %In our example, we evaluated the utility of synthetic data by comparing original and synthetic datasets on several metrics.

\columnbreak % Force the end of the column -------------------------------------

% Data utility %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Data utility}

%\textit{Data utility} refers to the \textbf{usefulness of the data for the intended purpose}. 
The \textit{utility of synthetic data} is measured by how the results from analyses of synthetic data differ from those derived from the real data \cite{2018_Snoke}.
There is a \textbf{risk-utility trade-off} in anonymizing data.
% Balancing data utility and privacy is essential. High utility ensures synthetic data's effectiveness for research, while privacy measures minimize re-identification risk.

\captionof{figure}{Difference in distribution between Original and Synthetic dataset}

\vspace{0.5cm}

The plots compare marginal distribution in selected variables for both the original and synthetic datasets. The similarity in the histograms and bar plots suggests that the synthetic data maintains the original data's univariate structure.

\vspace{0.5cm}

%Propensity Mean Squared Error ($pMSE$) and its Standardized Ratio ($S_{pMSE}$) are used to compare the similarity between synthetic and original datasets. $pMSE$ is derived from a propensity score model, where the propensity score is the probability that a given data point belongs to the synthetic dataset rather than the original dataset. A lower $pMSE$ indicates better similarity between the datasets.
%$S_{pMSE}$ accounts for the expected mean squared error if the datasets were perfectly separable. It normalizes the $pMSE$ by dividing it by the $pMSE$ of a "null" model where the datasets are completely random.

%\begin{equation}
%\text{$pMSE$} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (P_i - %Y_i)^2 \quad
%S_{pMSE} = \frac{\text{$pMSE$}}%{\text{$pMSE$}_{\text{null}}}

\vspace{0,5cm}

Propensity Mean Squared Error ($pMSE$) and its ratio to its null expectation ($S_{pMSE}$) are used to compare the similarity between synthetic and original datasets. $pMSE$ are calculated for each variable to assess the quality of the synthetic data for each individual variable. 
The $pMSE$ for the whole dataset is 0.002812907, which indicates a high degree of similarity between synthetic and real dataset.


%$pMSE$ is derived from a propensity score model, where the propensity score is the probability that a given data point belongs to the synthetic dataset rather than the original dataset. A lower $pMSE$ indicates better similarity.

%The variable \textit{age} shows a $pMSE$ of 0.000001 and an $S_{pMSE}$ of 0.380055, indicating a close match between the synthetic and original datasets. Similarly, \textit{gender} exhibits an extremely low $pMSE$ and an $S_{pMSE}$ of 0.456684, suggesting excellent similarity. For \textit{married} status, the $pMSE$ is 0.000001 with an $S_{pMSE}$ of 0.296588, reflecting strong similarity between the datasets.

%The variable \textit{religion} has a slightly higher $pMSE$ of 0.000010 and an $S_{pMSE}$ of 0.927885, indicating that while the datasets are fairly similar, some differences exist. \textit{Education} shows moderate similarity with a $pMSE$ of 0.000002 and an $S_{pMSE}$ of 0.684630. The \textit{urban} variable has a low $pMSE$ of 0.000001 and an $S_{pMSE}$ of 0.458887, denoting good similarity.

%However, \textit{engnat} (native English speaker status) presents a higher $S_{pMSE}$ of 1.952587, indicating differences between the datasets. Variable \textit{hand} demonstrates excellent similarity with a $pMSE$ of 0.000001 and an $S_{pMSE}$ of 0.220005. \textit{Orientation} is similar, with a $pMSE$ of 0.000002 and an $S_{pMSE}$ of 0.366338.

%Race has a $pMSE$ of 0.000008 and an $S_{pMSE}$ of 1.262795, suggesting some distinguishable differences between the datasets. The variable voted shows strong similarity with a $pMSE$ of 0.000001 and an $S_{pMSE}$ of 0.435028. Lastly, familysize stands out with the highest $S_{pMSE}$ of 3.208686 and a $pMSE$ of 0.000006, indicating significant differences between the original and synthetic data for this variable. Overall, while most variables show strong similarity between the datasets, engnat, race, and familysize may require further refinement in the synthetic data generation process to achieve better alignment with the original data.
