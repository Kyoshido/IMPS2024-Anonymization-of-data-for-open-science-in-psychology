\section{BACKGROUND}

There is a great demand for more research data to be made openly available.
The reproducibility of findings is in crisis, and more openly available data would make research more transparent and accessible.
Many psychological datasets contain \textbf{demographic and health variables} that \textbf{require proper protection against disclosure}.
Unfortunately, many datasets cannot be publicly available for privacy reasons.

Research data that results from publicly funded research should be:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable} (‘\textbf{FAIR} principles’) \cite{2022_EUA}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% METHODOLOGY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{METHODOLOGY}

A key concern with the disclosure of personal data is whether an attacker can gain any new information about an individual. \\
To enable dissemination and, therefore, to open data, researchers may use methods of \textbf{Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC)} \cite{2012_Hundepool}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\ding{228}]  \textbf{SDC} is traditional approach to protecting outputs against re-identification
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Non-perturbation methods} (reduce provided information)
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Local suppression (delete high-risk records)
                    \item Global recoding (create broader categories)
                \end{itemize}   
            \item \textbf{Perturbation methods} (modify data)
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Noise masking
                    \item Record swapping
                    \item Microaggregaation
                \end{itemize}             
        \end{itemize}   
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Traditional SDC methods alone are insufficient to protect data}. It is necessary to also use a more modern approach.

\begin{itemize}
     \item[\ding{228}] \textbf{Synthetic data generation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item mimics the original data
            \item creates artificial data that can be safely disseminated
        \end{itemize}        
\end{itemize}

% DATA UTILITY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{DATA UTILITY}

\textit{Data utility} is the \textbf{usefulness of the data for the intended purpose}. On the other side stands \textit{re-identification risk}, which is the risk that an intruder can link a record in the released data to a specific individual in the population. So there is \textbf{risk-utility trade-off}.

\section{Forthcoming Research}

We will focus on the anonymization of longitudinal data.
%The challenges of anonymizing longitudinal data are data granularity, temporal uniqueness, and dynamic features. 
Given the sensitive nature of health data, we aim to develop and implement innovative tools for generating synthetic longitudinal data.
